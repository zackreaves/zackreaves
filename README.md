- Hi, I’m Zack
- I'm primarily interested in making my own life easier with code, with some things being put together for fun.
- If anything I make is useful to you treat it like it's under the MIT license unless otherwise specified.
- I'm always looking for feedback, so let me hear it if you have it.
